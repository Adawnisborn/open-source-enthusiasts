[Preston Crowe](https://github.com/vaugerbird)
I don't quite have a portfolio site, but I do have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-crowe-326261184/)!
As also evidenced by my GitHub bio, I enjoy tinkering with electronics. With that, I also enjoy building new electronics and upcycling old electronics into new ones. I also really enjoy metal fabrication things like welding and machining.
