My name is [Preston Crowe](https://github.com/vaugerbird)!
I don't quite have a portfolio site, but I do have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preston-crowe-326261184/)!
As also evidenced by my GitHub bio, I enjoy tinkering with electronics. Along with that, I also enjoy building new electronics and upcycling old electronics into new ones. I as well enjoy metal fabrication like welding and machining.
